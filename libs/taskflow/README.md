Taskflow helps you quickly write parallel and heterogeneous tasks programs in modern C++

# Why Taskflow?

Taskflow is faster, more expressive, and easier for drop-in integration
than many of existing task programming frameworks
in handling complex parallel workloads.

![](image/performance.png)

Taskflow lets you quickly implement task decomposition strategies
that incorporate both regular and irregular compute patterns,
together with an efficient *work-stealing* scheduler to optimize your multithreaded performance.

| :------------: | :-------------: |
| ![](image/static_graph.svg) | <img align="right" src="image/dynamic_graph.svg" width="100%"> |

Taskflow supports conditional tasking for you to make rapid control-flow decisions
across dependent tasks to implement cycles and conditions that were otherwise difficult to do
with existing tools.

| [Conditional Tasking](#conditional-tasking) |
| :-----------------: |
| ![](image/condition.svg) |

Taskflow is composable. You can create large parallel graphs through
composition of modular and reusable blocks that are easier to optimize
at an individual scope.

| :---------------: |

Taskflow supports heterogeneous tasking for you to
accelerate a wide range of scientific computing applications
by harnessing the power of CPU-GPU collaborative computing.

| [Concurrent CPU-GPU Tasking](#concurrent-cpu-gpu-tasking) |
| :-----------------: |

Taskflow provides visualization and tooling needed for profiling Taskflow programs.

We are committed to support trustworthy developments for both academic and industrial research projects
in parallel computing. Check out [Who is Using Taskflow](#who-is-using-taskflow) and what our users say:

+ *"Taskflow is the cleanest Task API I've ever seen." [Damien Hocking @Corelium Inc](http://coreliuminc.com)*

# Start Your First Taskflow Program

The following program (`simple.cpp`) creates four tasks 
`A`, `B`, `C`, and `D`, where `A` runs before `B` and `C`, and `D`
runs after `B` and `C`.
When `A` finishes, `B` and `C` can run in parallel.



```cpp
#include <taskflow/taskflow.hpp>  // Taskflow is header-only

int main(){
  
  tf::Executor executor;
  tf::Taskflow taskflow;

  auto [A, B, C, D] = taskflow.emplace(  // create 4 tasks
    [] () { std::cout << "TaskA\n"; },
    [] () { std::cout << "TaskB\n"; },
    [] () { std::cout << "TaskC\n"; },
    [] () { std::cout << "TaskD\n"; } 
  );                                  
                                      
  A.precede(B, C);  // A runs before B and C
  D.succeed(B, C);  // D runs after  B and C
                                      
  executor.run(taskflow).wait(); 

  return 0;
}
```

Taskflow is *header-only* and there is no wrangle with installation.
To compile the program, clone the Taskflow project and 
tell the compiler to include the [headers](./taskflow/).

```bash
~$ git clone https://github.com/taskflow/taskflow.git  # clone it only once
~$ g++ -std=c++17 simple.cpp -I taskflow/taskflow -O2 -pthread -o simple
~$ ./simple
TaskA
TaskC 
TaskB 
TaskD
```

# Visualize Your First Taskflow Program

Taskflow comes with a built-in profiler, 
[TFProf](https://taskflow.github.io/tfprof/), 
for you to profile and visualize taskflow programs
in an easy-to-use web-based interface.

![](doxygen/images/tfprof.png)

```bash
# run the program with the environment variable TF_ENABLE_PROFILER enabled
~$ TF_ENABLE_PROFILER=simple.json ./simple
~$ cat simple.json
[
{"executor":"0","data":[{"worker":0,"level":0,"data":[{"span":[172,186],"name":"0_0","type":"static"},{"span":[187,189],"name":"0_1","type":"static"}]},{"worker":2,"level":0,"data":[{"span":[93,164],"name":"2_0","type":"static"},{"span":[170,179],"name":"2_1","type":"static"}]}]}
]
# paste the profiling json data to https://taskflow.github.io/tfprof/
```

In addition to execution diagram, you can dump the graph to a DOT format 
and visualize it using a number of free [GraphViz][GraphViz] tools.

```
// dump the taskflow graph to a DOT format through std::cout
taskflow.dump(std::cout); 
```
